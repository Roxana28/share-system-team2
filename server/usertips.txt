# "Testing" the server with the curl library

Upload (POST):

    curl --form "file=@file3.dat" http://127.0.0.1:5000/API/V1/files/test6/test7/file10.dat

Download (GET):

    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/API/V1/files/index.jpeg

Instead, there is a graphic interface (see upload.html attached file) to directly try upload
one file from the browser to the server root directory (upload).

    curl localhost:5000/API/V1/signup --data "username=youruser&password=yourpassword"
