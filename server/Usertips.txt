-----------  Using curl library to call server upload/download file ------------

upload example (GET):

curl --form "file=@file3.dat" http://127.0.0.1:5000/API/V1/files/test6/test7/file10.dat

download example:

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/API/V1/files/index.jpeg 
Note: file index.jpeg must exists in the upload directory

Instead, there is a graphic interface (see upload.html attached file) to directly try upload one file from the browser to the server root directory (upload).
