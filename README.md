# Server

To start the server, go to the server directory and type:

    $ python server.py [--debug | --verbose | -v <level>]
    
NB: The file storage root directory is created inside the current directory,
i.e. the directory where you launch the server from, *not* inside the server module.
Therefore, we suggest to start server from the directory that contains it.
